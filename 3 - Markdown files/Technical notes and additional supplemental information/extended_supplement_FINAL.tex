Let \(r_i\) be the death rate of interest (reported COVID-19 deaths or
excess all cause mortality) per 100,000 in country \(i\), and \(d\) be
US deaths over the period of study. Let \(p\) be the US 2019 population,
\(p=329,064,917\) according to the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control. We estimate difference in deaths: \begin{align}

between time \(T\) and the end of the period of study and \(d_T\) be US

(e.g., 60 days after \(\geq\) 1 case per 1,000,000 population). Let
\(T\) be the time that the US meets the criteria. Letting \(r_{iT_i}\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There has been debate in the epidemiological community regarding
  whether focus on total deaths or deaths per capita early in the
  pandemic. Given a fixed number introductions, we do not expect that
  early in a pandemic, a virus would spread faster in a larger
  population than in a smaller one. Nevertheless, we defer to per capita
  measures due to the geographic and demographic diversity of the United
  States that renders it likely more similar to a combination of small
  countries than a single countries, and as viral introductions may be
  proportional to population, especially over time. In addition, this
  measure may better capture the pandemic's relative impact in terms of
  general perceptions and disruption.
\item
  Due to large sample sizes, traditional statistical inference around
  differences in mortality rates often have narrow confidence intervals
  and meets traditional standards for ``statistical significance'' (see
  e.g.,
  \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2767980}{Weinberger et. al}).
  As our other outcome measures (e.g.~excess deaths) are invertible
  monotone transformation of mortality rates, statistical conclusions
  about the former apply to the latter. However, other sources of
  uncertainty affect our results more than statistical randomness, as we
  show in sensitivity analyses.
\item
  Our main analyses focus on \emph{calendar time}, assessing the
  difference in deaths if the US death rate became comparable to another
  country's death rate after a particular time. We consider both May and
  June for this shift, allowing 1-2 months for policy response beginning
  in March and assuming \(\sim 1\) month to death from exposure. We use
  calendar time as our main specification because 1) the pandemic
  affected most countries at similar times (Table \ref{tbl.S1}), and 2)
  to the extent that there were differences, countries were able to
  react to the experiences of peer countries (e.g.~by responding earlier
  even if the pandemic affected them later). However, we may want to
  \emph{adjust for pandemic timing} if, for example, countries were
  unable to gain political will to implement measures before evidence of
  a more local pandemic and/or if the pandemic was particularly
  difficult to control until cases reached a specific threshold. We
  therefore considered 2 sensitivity analyses in (Table \ref{tbl.S1},
  \ref{tbl.S2}, \ref{tbl.S3}): 1) assuming the US had a comparable
  mortality rate to a country 60 days after reaching 1 case per million
  (Scenario D) and 2) assuming the US had a comparable mortality rate to
  a country 60 days after reaching 5 deaths (Scenario E). The former
  estimates fewer deaths averted than May estimates while the latter
  estimates more.
\item
  For excess all-cause mortality, we use 2015-2019 as comparison years
  by default, based on the CDC's excess death
  \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm#data-tables}{estimates}.
  In sensitivity analysis, we also presented results using 2018-2019
  (Table \ref{tbl.S3}), which has a slightly lower estimate of excess
  all-cause mortality (217K vs.~235K) but similar overall comparisons
  across countries.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Country-level data}\label{country-level-data}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Spain adjusted its cumulative COVID-19 death toll downward (and then
  partially upward) during May and June 2020. We smoothed this to be
  monotonic over this time period by setting cumulative deaths between
  May 23, 2020 and June 18, 2020 to be equal to the reported death toll
  on June 19, 2020 (Figure \ref{supp.fig.spain}).
\item
  For recent periods in which some deaths may not yet have been
  reported, the United States CDC provides estimates of both unweighted
  deaths and deaths weighted to attempt to adjust for underreporting. To
  be conservative in our estimate of excess deaths, we use the latter
  (Figure \ref{supp.fig.weighting}). In our excess all-cause mortality
  analyses, we use through week 30 (July 25, 2020). While difficult to
  pinpoint a precise cut-off at which data were sufficiently complete
  for inclusion, both CDC reported deaths and COVID-19 attributed deaths
  (see ``USA\_2.csv'') began to decline through August despite increases
  in deaths from COVID Tracking Project, suggesting ddelays in reporting
  by at least week 32-33. Week 30 was also the last time point at which
  data were available for Canada, allowing us to include the country our
  excess all-cause mortality analysis.
\item
  Several countries reported lower than average all-cause mortality in
  2020 prior to the pandemic (Figure \ref{supp.weekly.deaths}). For this
  reason, we start measurement of all-cause mortality after the pandemic
  began in a country (\(\geq\) 1 case per million, generally week 9-10).
\item
  We lacked sufficient data from Australia, Japan, and South Korea to do
  direct comparisons in our excess deaths analysis (Table 2 of main
  paper), but analyses of available data suggest that these low
  mortality countries did not experience meaningful excess mortality
  during 2020
  (e.g.~\href{https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-23/coronavirus-australia-excess-deaths-data-analysis/12321162}{Australia},
  \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-29/japan-dodged-surge-in-total-fatalities-during-peak-virus-month}{Japan},
  \href{https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{South Korea})
\item
  France provided a
  \href{https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4487988?sommaire=4487854}{file}
  of estimated deaths beginning in February for the years 2018-2020.
  Following \emph{The Economist}
  \href{https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker}{GitHub},
  we used France's
  \href{https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/4190491}{death registers} to
  fill in 2015-2017. When we compared the death registers in 2018 to the
  first file, we found that the latter had lower deaths by week, and
  therefore to be conservative in estimates of excess deaths and
  following the approach of \emph{The Economist}, we only included
  deaths with a valid department code in ``location of death.''
